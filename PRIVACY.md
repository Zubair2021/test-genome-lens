# Privacy Policy - GenomeLens

**Last Updated: October 1, 2025**

## Overview

GenomeLens is designed with privacy as a core principle. This document explains how your data is handled when using the application.

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only

- **All sequence data stays in your browser**: GenomeLens stores all sequences, annotations, and projects exclusively in your browser's IndexedDB.
- **No server transmission**: By default, no sequence data is sent to any server. All processing happens client-side in your browser.
- **Offline capable**: The app can work completely offline after initial load.

### What We Store Locally

- Project metadata (names, descriptions, timestamps)
- Sequence data (DNA/RNA/protein sequences)
- Annotations and features
- User preferences (view settings, UI state)

### What We DON'T Store

- No personal identifying information
- No usage analytics
- No tracking cookies
- No user accounts or authentication data

## Data Collection

### Analytics

GenomeLens does **NOT** include any analytics, tracking, or telemetry. We do not collect:

- Usage statistics
- Performance metrics
- Error reports
- User behavior data

### Third-Party Services

GenomeLens does not integrate with any third-party services for:

- Sequence analysis
- Data storage
- User tracking
- Advertisement

## Optional Features

### File Import/Export

- **Local files only**: When you import files, they are processed entirely in your browser.
- **Export control**: You control when and where sequences are exported. Exports are saved directly to your device.

### Sharing (if implemented)

If future versions include sharing features:

- Sharing will be **explicit opt-in** only
- You will be clearly informed before any data leaves your browser
- Shared data will use end-to-end encryption where possible

## Data Security

### Browser Security

- Data is protected by your browser's security model
- IndexedDB is isolated per-origin
- No third-party access to your local data

### Recommendations

We recommend:

- Using a modern, updated browser
- Enabling browser security features
- Backing up important projects via export
- Being cautious when sharing exported files

## Data Deletion

### Complete Control

You have complete control over your data:

- **Clear all data**: Use your browser's "Clear Site Data" feature
- **Delete projects**: Delete individual projects from within the app
- **Uninstall**: Simply stop using the app; all data remains in your browser

### Browser Storage Limits

- Browser storage quotas vary by browser and system
- GenomeLens will alert you if storage is nearly full
- You can delete old projects to free space

## Children's Privacy

GenomeLens does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone. The app is suitable for educational use.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy as the application evolves. Material changes will be documented in the repository changelog.

## Open Source

GenomeLens is open source. You can:

- Inspect the code to verify privacy claims
- Host your own instance for additional control
- Modify the code for your needs (per MIT license)

## Contact

For privacy concerns or questions:

- Open an issue on the GitHub repository
- Review the source code yourself

## Compliance

As a client-side only application with no data collection:

- **GDPR**: Not applicable (no personal data processing)
- **CCPA**: Not applicable (no personal data sale or collection)
- **HIPAA**: Not a HIPAA-covered application

**Important**: If you plan to use GenomeLens with sensitive or regulated data, ensure your deployment and usage comply with relevant regulations. Consider hosting your own instance and implementing additional security measures as needed.
