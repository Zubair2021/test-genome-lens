2. Clone your fork
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
5. Make your changes
6. Run tests: `npm test`
7. Commit your changes
8. Push and create a pull request

## Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code style
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Extract reusable logic to custom hooks
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props

### State Management

- Use Zustand for global state
- Keep state minimal and normalized
- Use local state for UI-only state

### Performance

- Use virtualization for large lists
- Lazy load heavy modules
- Use Web Workers for CPU-intensive tasks
- Profile before optimizing

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Aim for high coverage on utilities
- Include E2E tests for critical flows

### Safety First

**Important**: GenomeLens must NOT include features that:

- Automate primer design for synthesis
- Generate step-by-step cloning protocols
- Integrate with synthesis/ordering services
- Produce actionable wet-lab instructions

Any PR that includes such features will be rejected.

### Allowed Features

âœ… Sequence viewing and visualization  
âœ… Read-only analysis and statistics  
âœ… Annotation editing  
âœ… File import/export  
âœ… Search and navigation  
âœ… Performance improvements  
âœ… UI/UX enhancements  

## Pull Request Process

1. **Describe your changes**: Clearly explain what and why
2. **Link issues**: Reference related issues
3. **Add tests**: Include tests for new features
4. **Update docs**: Update README if needed
5. **Check CI**: Ensure all checks pass
6. **Request review**: Tag maintainers for review

### PR Title Format

```
